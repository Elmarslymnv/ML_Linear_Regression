# ML_Linear_Regression
## In linear_regression_1.ipynb file , I solved this problem below :
### Due to the outbreak of 2019-nCoV, WHO is alerted to several cases of pneumonia and wants to know
### how this virus will affect the population, specifically whether the Healthcare System in place is
### capable of addressing this issue. Therefore, you are asked to predict next 7-days 2019-nCoV 
### cumulative Confirmed, Infected, Recovered, Death cases using Linear Regression Model.

## In linear_regression_2.ipynb file , I solved this problem below :
### Your neighbor is a real estate agent and wants some help predicting housing prices for regions in the USA.
### It would be great if you could somehow create a model for her that allows her to put in a few features of a house
### and returns back an estimate of what the house would sell for.
### She has asked you if you could help her out with your new data science skills. You say
### yes, and decide that Linear Regression might be a good path to solve this problem!
